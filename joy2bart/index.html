	<p>Happy Birthday to my Mentor and my Trainer.<br>
	You have always told me to be that bold and strong<br>
	 girl who is fearless in achieving her goals. <br>
	That is the person I am today because of you.<br>
 when I'm down or giving up, your words<br>
 of couragement just bring back that strength and <br>
joy again. I am so happy and grateful to have a person<br>
 like you in my life who I can look up to the way a<br> 
daughter looks up to her father.I see you going higher and higher in the ladder of <br>
success.</p>
	<h4>LOVE YOU</h4>
		<p>From your Baby Joy</p>
